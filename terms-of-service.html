  <h1>Terms of Service for CashXRise</h1>

  <p>Welcome to CashXRise. By using this app, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read them carefully. If you do not agree with any part of the terms, you may not use the app.</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>CashXRise is an Android app that rewards users with virtual coins for completing tasks, surveys, and offers. These coins can be redeemed for cash via UPI. We are committed to offering a safe, transparent, and user-friendly experience.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>To use CashXRise, you must be at least 13 years old. If you are under 18, you must use the app under the supervision of a parent or guardian. Users must be residents of India to redeem coins via UPI.</p>

  <h2>3. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>CashXRise allows users to earn virtual rewards called "coins" by completing simple tasks, offers, and surveys. These coins can be exchanged for real money, which is transferred directly to the user's UPI ID, subject to eligibility and verification.</p>

  <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree not to share your account or engage in any form of cheating, automation, or fraudulent behavior.</p>

  <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
  <p>We take your privacy seriously. All user data is securely stored using Firebase services and will not be sold or shared with third parties. See our <a href="https://cashxrise.github.io/cashxrise-site/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

  <h2>6. Rewards & Redemption</h2>
  <p>Users earn virtual coins by completing tasks, surveys, and other partner activities within the CashXRise app. These coins can be redeemed for real cash via UPI (Unified Payments Interface) in India once the user reaches the required minimum threshold.</p>

  <p><strong>Redemption Terms:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Redemption is subject to verification and may take up to 7 working days to process.</li>
    <li>Users must ensure their UPI ID is valid and correctly entered.</li>
    <li>CashXRise is not responsible for delays or failed payments due to incorrect UPI details.</li>
    <li>Each user may be subject to daily, weekly, or monthly redemption limits to prevent abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We reserve the right to reverse or block rewards if suspicious, fraudulent, or automated activity is detected. Redemption options, minimum withdrawal amounts, and exchange rates may change at any time without notice.</p>

  <h2>7. Prohibited Activities</h2>
  <p>Users are prohibited from using bots, VPNs, fake accounts, or exploiting bugs to gain coins. Such actions will result in suspension or permanent ban of the account and forfeiture of earned coins.</p>

  <h2>8. Modifications</h2>
  <p>CashXRise reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
